# Introduction

[JobRouterÂ®](https://www.jobrouter.com/) is a scalable digitalisation platform
which links processes, data and documents. This JobRouter REST Client eases the
access to the REST API.

The library can be used to automate tasks in PHP scripts like importing or
synchronising data in the JobData module, start processes or working with
archive documents. The authentication is done in the background, so you
concentrate on your business domain.

The [PSR-7 standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) is used, so you'll
get in touch with objects which implements the `ResponseInterface`.
Currently, the JobRouter REST Client uses
[nyholm/psr7](https://github.com/nyholm/psr7>) for the PSR-7 implementation
and [Buzz](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/buzz>) as HTTP client. But that
shouldn't bother you.

The library is available under the
[GNU General Public License v2.0](https://github.com/jobrouter/php-rest-client/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).
You can also have a look into the
[source code](https://github.com/jobrouter/php-rest-client) on GitHub or
